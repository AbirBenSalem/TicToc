# TicToc


## Problem Definition

❖	We consider a computer program playing Tic Tac Toe game with a human. The program makes his best to win the game.

❖This game is well known in France under the name of " jeu du morpion ".

## Rules of the game :

❖	The goal is to be able to line up three circles or three crosses in a grid of 3 out of 3.
❖	Players choose one of the elements, and play alternately.
❖	The game ends when one of the players has succeeded in aligning three elements, or when the 9 boxes have been filled.
Given the advantage given to the player who starts the game, it is recommended to play several rounds, by varying the player who starts.

## Project scope

❖	There will be a square game board divided into nine tiles spaces. 
❖	The player selects either an "X" or an "O" on one of the grid spaces using keyboard keys. 
❖	The game is over when one player claims 3 grid spaces in a row or there are no moves left.
❖	First both the players are humans and then the first player is human and second player will be computer.
❖	Game can be continue from the previous paused session(History of game is available)
❖	Keyboard keys are replaced with mouse clicks for the game play. 
❖	So now when the player clicks on one of the grid spaces, it will be assigned either an "X" or an "O"
